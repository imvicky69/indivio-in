    question: 'What happens after the first year?',
    answer: 'After the initial one-year term, you only need to pay a small annual renewal fee, which starts at just â‚¹999/year. This covers your hosting, security, maintenance, and ongoing support.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use my own domain name (e.g., www.myschool.com)?',
    answer: 'Yes! Our Growth and Pro plans are designed for you to connect your own custom domain name, strengthening your school\'s brand and online identity.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a separate setup fee?',

  },
  {
    question: 'Can I upgrade my plan later?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. We understand that your needs can change. You can easily upgrade your plan at any time to access more features as your school grows.',
